The thermal network consists of heat sources (some of which are temperature dependent) and thermal resistances. The latter are given by the properties of the mechanical design (heat conductivities of the materials) and the geometry of the heat path. The geometry is generally 3-dimensional, but it is the strategy of the simple network models to lump the 3-dimensional behaviour into one thermal resistance parameter. In the models discussed here we have used a granularity corresponding to single detector modules for which the thermal resistance has been modelled. The temperatures in the model are then given for the nodes in the network in analogy to the potentials in an electrical network.

The complexity of the thermal network used in this study (see figure~\ref{fig:thermalmodel}) is given by the variety of different temperature-dependent heat sources in the ATLAS strip system. In addition to the sensor leakage currents these are the digital power for each type of chip, and the heat generated by the FEAST chip, which is providing the DC-DC conversion on the detector. In the ATLAS SCT modules all these components are located on top of the sensors, so that the heat generated in them flows through the sensor into the support structure, the stave (barrel) or petal (endcap) core with the embedded cooling pipe. In the network model the heat flow from these sources is combined and flowing through a common impedance $R_\text{M}$ to the sink at a temperature $T_\text{C}$. For each of the temperature-dependent heat sources (ABC, HCC, FEAST and the sensor) we have added a resistance from the common temperature $T_\text{mod}$ to allow for a finite and different heat path for each if them. Finally, in the case of the barrel system, there is an additional source of heat for the last module on the stave, which is the adjacent End-of-substructure (EOS) card, which is modeled by an additional source with an impedance for its special heat path.

This is a more complex thermal network than the one studied in ref.~\cite{Beck:2010zzd}, where an analytical solution for the determination of thermal stability was given. In particular because of the non-linear temperature dependence of some of the heat sources it is not possible any more to solve the set of equations describing the model here analytically. However, the set of equations is still sufficiently small to solve it numerically using readily available functions in Mathematica (used in the barrel model) or xxx (used in the endcap system).
