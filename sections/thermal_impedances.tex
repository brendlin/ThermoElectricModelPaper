\textit{(This section should be discussed and agreed between Graham and Yu-Heng)}

The cooling path between the sources dissipating electrical power and the cooling fluid is three-dimensional and includes components with orthotropic thermal conductivity. Hence the prediction of temperature at any node of the model requires a 3d thermal FEA Ref [Abaqus, Ansys]. However, the thermal conductivities of the components along the path are approximately constant, so that the temperature rise above the coolant temperature of any node $i$ ($i=$~ABC, HCC, AMAC, FEAST, tape, RHV, or sensor) of the structure, \mbox{$\Delta T_i \equiv T_i - T_c$,} in the thermal network model is adequately described by a linear sum of contributions from individual sources, i.e:

\begin{equation}
\Delta T_i = R_i P_i + \left(R_{C} + R_{M}\right)\sum_j P_j, 
\label{eq:deltaT_expression}
\end{equation}
where we have momentarily ignored the EOS contribution.

In order to extract the thermal impedances for the thermal network model the finite element model is run multiple times, with each heat source (or group of similar sources) switched on in turn with a representative amount of heat. For each of these cases the temperature of all nodes in the thermal network model (Figure~\ref{fig:thermalmodel}) are calculated. The temperature of a node is here taken as the average of the temperatures for all the gridpoints in the FEA model within the volume of the object corresponding to the node\footnote{This is particularly interesting in the case of the sensor, which fills a large volume, with a potentially large range of temperatures. Ref.~\cite{Beck:2010zzd} is not clear about the exact definition of the sensor temperature to be used for the calculation of the thermal impedance. In fact, at the time we were still using the maximum sensor temperature for the calculation of thermal stability. Since then we have acquired more experience with thermal network models and found that the best agreement is achieved if the average sensor temperature is used.}. The thermal impedances are then obtained from a fit of eq.~\ref{eq:deltaT_expression} using the temperature data for all nodes for all cases of heat injection.

%(or group of similar sources) switched on in turn with a representative amount of heat, and the temperature rise noted for each of the nodes of interest, which are those in the thermal network model (Figure~\ref{fig:thermalmodel}).  

%BEGIN ALTERNATE DESCRIPTION
%Ignoring the EOS components momentarily, the temperature rise $\Delta T_i \equiv T_i - T_c$ of a given node $i$ can be expressed as:
%\begin{equation}
%\Delta T_i = R_i P_i + \left(R_{C} + R_{M}\right)\sum_j P_j\,, \quad i,j=(\text{ABC},\text{HCC},\text{AMAC},\text{FEAST},\text{tape},\text{RHV},\text{sensor}),
%\label{eq:deltaT_expression}
%\end{equation}
%where the powered components are represented by the index $j$.
%In order to extract the coefficients $R_{i}$, $R_{C}$ and $R_{M}$,
%the finite element model is run multiple times, with each heat source (or group of similar sources)
%switched on in turn with a representative amount of heat, and the temperature rise
%noted for each of the nodes of interest, which are those in the thermal network model (Figure~\ref{fig:thermalmodel}).
%
%Using this data from the FEA, the quantity $R_{CM}\equiv R_{C} + R_{M}$ is first solved by
%focusing on the set of measurements where the measured temperature node ($i$)
%is not associated to the powered component ($j$).
%In these cases, the relationship can be expressed as:
%\begin{equation}
%\Delta T_i = R_{CM} P_j,
%\end{equation}
%assuming that only one source $j$ is powered at a time.
%Each pair of values for delivered power and $\Delta T$ is plotted in Fig.~\ref{fig:solving_for_Rcm}.
%The data is fit to a function of the form $\Delta T = R_{CM} \times P$;
%the slope of the line corresponds to the thermal impedance $R_{CM}$.
%The remaining thermal impedances ($R_\text{FEAST}$, $R_\text{ABC}$, etc.) are calculated by
%subsituting $R_{CM}$ into the equations remaining from Eq.~\ref{eq:deltaT_expression}.
%The value $R_{EOS}$ is calculated using a simlar procedure.

%END ALTERNATE DESCRIPTION

For a barrel module the agreement of the network temperatures using the thermal impedances from the fit with the data from FEA is better than 0.5$^\circ$C for all nodes. This procedure is performed for both, the EOS and the normal module. The thermal impedance from the sensor to the sink ($R_\text{M}+T_\text{C}$) in all cases is between 1.1 and 1.4~$^\circ$C/W, but higher values (between 10 and 20~$^\circ$C/W) are found for other impedances in the network ($R_\text{HCC}$ and $R_\text{FEAST}$), mostly because these are for components with a small footprint constituting a bottleneck for the heat flow.

There are two recognised departures from linearity of the thermal path: the rise in thermal conductivity of the silicon sensor with decreasing temperature and the rise in heat transfer coefficient (HTC) to the evaporating CO$_2$ coolant with increasing thermal flux. The FEA models are run using mean values for these quantities appropriate to the operating conditions, and the thermoelectric model results are insensitive to the variations expected in practice.

\textit{[GAB: Should we expand on this with plots and tables? There are detailed differences between stave and petal that might be confusing, e.g. re coefficients for the sensor T.      Maybe all we could addin the end is confusion! ].}
