Explain the specific challenges in the strip detector that are parameterized and modeled
in our case.

\subsubsection{DCDC converter}

The DCDC converter (FEAST) supplies a low-voltage (1.5~V) current to the ABC130 and HCC front-end
chips on the module.
The efficiency of the FEAST depends on its temperature as well as the output (load) current
load delivered to the front-end chips. To correctly model the FEAST efficiency, experimental
measurements are performed to characterize the dependence and fitted with a functional form.

To measure the FEAST efficiency, the FEAST power board was glued to an aluminum cold plate, cooled
with CO$_2$, an powered with the nominal working input and output voltages (11~V input, 1.5~V output).
The temperature of the FEAST is measured with an NTC thermistor and PTAT sensor residing on the FEAST,
for a range of load currents up to the maximum design current of 4A\footnote

}.

The data is then fit with a function with sufficient parameters to ensure reasonable agreement; the
choice of functional form has no physical interpretation. Figure~\ref{fig:feast_eff} depicts the
FEAST efficiency data and the parameterized fit used in the model.
