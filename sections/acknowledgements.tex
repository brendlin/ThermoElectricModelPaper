The evaluation of the thermo-electrical model depends critically on the input parameters to the model. To capture the whole of the system, these need to distill all that is known of the system, and we are therefore indebted to the whole of the ITk strip community. In particular, we would like to thank Tony Affolder, Kyle Cormier, Ian Dawson, Sergio Diez Cornell, Laura Gonella, Ashley Greenall, Alex Grillo, Paul Keener, Steve McMahon, Paul Miyagawa, Craig Sawyer, Francis Ward and Tony Weidberg for all their inputs to this work.

The research was supported and financed in part by the UK's Science and Technology Facilities Council and the Helmholtz Association (HGF) in Germany.
